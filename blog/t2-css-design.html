  <h1>A Whirlwind of CSS</h1>
  <h2>Understanding the In's and Out's of CSS</h2>

     When it comes to understanding CSS, there are a lot of concepts to understand. On the one hand, I had a general idea of the concepts, but on the other hand, I found it difficult to know when to use them. Margin, padding, and borders are terms that are often used together. What exactly do they mean, and how when should we use them?

    <p>
      The easiest concept to understand, of the three I mentioned earlier, is border. Border simply takes the element in question and adds a line around it. Have you ever added a picture to a document in Microsoft Word? If you have, you will notice that one of the options to modify the picture is border. You can add a solid line, a dotted line, or increase the weight of the line. Essentially, CSS allows you to do the same with border.

        It took me some time to know when I could take advantage of padding. I like to think of a basketball court when trying to understand padding. Padding takes an element and moves it to the innermost layer. Instead of standing at the 3-point line, padding allows you to move to the free throw line.
    </p>
    <p> Last, but not least, margin adds spacing to the outside of the element. To simplify the terms, let me refer back to the basketball illustration. If padding is the free throw line, then margin is the 3-point line. If you add more to margin, you can move all the way to the half court line.

      I know it can be confusing, but with practice and playing around with the properties, it can make sense!
