  <h1>Dev Bootcamp</h1>
  <h2>Why I Chose to Learn Programming Here</h2>
  <h4>June 14, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      The video on the Dev Boocamp experience validated why I chose Dev Bootcamp. I know I will have support if I have any questions or concerns because we are all in this together. Dev Bootcamp seeks to foster a community of developers as opposed to being isolated and at times, frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dev Bootcamp is unique in that there is rigorous prep before walking into their doors. The prep is a confidence booster because there is a feeling of “Ok, I at least have background of what is going on.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Dev Bootcamp wants us to “expose our ignorance,” This means there is always room for questions. There is no need to be afraid of asking a “stupid question.”
