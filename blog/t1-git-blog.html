  <h2>Learning Git in a Week</h2>

      This week I learned all about Git. I've heard the terms Git and Github thrown around before, but I never fully understood the concepts until now. The reason Git exists is simple: to make the lives of developers easy.

    <p>
        The foundation of Git is version control. Essentially, this is a term that refers to the saving of a file. Version control allows users to keep track of changes they make in a file. If a user sees an error in a current project, he or she is able to access past work that was error free. Version control also is beneficial in team projects. Users can simultaneously make changes to a file and merge the changes to form a new file. Github is a hosting service that employs the use of version control. Github allows users to keep track of changes made to files through a series of commits. A commit is the point where a user can save the file he or she is working on. If a user has a bug, he or she can look back at past commits and work on them.
    </p>

        Developers should use Github when working on projects because it allows for teams to work off of files in a remote location. Gone are the days of passing a flash drive around. Github also allows for different users to make contributions to other users code. Github is an excellent tool for developers, and I highly recommend creating an account!
